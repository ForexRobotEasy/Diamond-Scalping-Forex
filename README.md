## Product Description

Diamond Scalping Forex is an automated trading robot designed to exploit price gaps in the Forex market. It aims to take advantage of small price differences between the bid and ask prices to generate profits. The robot places buy or sell trades based on certain conditions, allowing traders to potentially profit from short-term price movements.

Key Features:
- Scalping strategy: The robot uses a scalping strategy to take advantage of small price gaps.
- Trade execution: It automatically places buy or sell trades at the current market price.
- Time-based trading: It checks if enough time has passed since the last trade to avoid excessive trading.
- Trade management: The robot updates the last trade time and price after each trade.

Please note that this code is a sample and may require customization or additional features to fully replicate the functionality of the Diamond Scalping Forex robot.

## Code Explanation

The code starts with necessary libraries included and important variables defined. The `Trade.mqh` library is included for trade execution.

In the `OnInit` function, the robot initialization is handled. It prints a message to indicate that the robot has been initialized and returns the initialization result.

The `OnTick` function is called on each incoming tick. It checks if enough time has passed since the last trade. If so, it checks for a price gap to exploit. If the bid price has increased by more than 0.0005, a buy trade is placed at the current market price using the `Trade.Buy` function. If the ask price has decreased by more than 0.0005, a sell trade is placed using the `Trade.Sell` function. After each trade, the last trade time and price are updated, and a message is printed to indicate a new trade.

The `OnDeinit` function is called during deinitialization. It prints a message to indicate that the robot has been deinitialized.

Please note that this code is a simplified version of the Diamond Scalping Forex robot and may not include all the features or functionality of the original product. It is recommended to consult the official developer or use the MQL5 platform to find the official version of this product.
